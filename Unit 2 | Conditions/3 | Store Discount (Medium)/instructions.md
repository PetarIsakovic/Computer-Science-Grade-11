# Store Discount (Medium)  

A retail store has hired you to create a simple program that can calculate the discount available to customers that shop at the store during a special sale. The amount of discount given changes depending on how much they spend. Here is a chart showing the discount

| **Amount Spent** | **Discount** |
| --- | --- |
| $0.01 - $40.00 | 10% off |
| $40.01 - $80.00 | 20% off |
| $80.01 - $120.00 | 30% off |
| Over $120 | 40% off |

Create a program that will ask how much the customer spent. It will use that information to then display which category they are in, how much they have saved, and the new total amount.
