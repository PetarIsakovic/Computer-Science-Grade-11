# Temp Conversion Again (Mild)  

Create a program that will take a number in Celsius and convert it to Fahrenheit or vice-versa. See the image below. You can google how the math works ;) The look of this image was taken on a MAC so it may look different than yours. It should have 2 JLabels, 2 JTextFields, and 2 JButtons. The F -> C button changes Fahrenheit to Celsius. The C -> F button changes Celsius to Fahrenheit

**Note:** You may have done this question before. Go find your solution and see if you can modify it to work with a GUI instead of the Scanner.
