# Add Them Up (Medium)  

Write a program that will prompt the user to enter in a positive integer. It will then calculate the sum from 1 up to that number. 

**Hint:** You will need to use some kind of accumulator variable that starts at 0 and adds numbers as the loop progresses. Start this question by writing a loop that will print to the screen all the numbers from 1 to the number they entered. Next, instead of printing the number to the screen, you will want to add that number into a variable (the accumulator).


## SAMPLE RUNTIME OUTPUT:

Please enter an integer to add up to

  ```78```
  
The sum from 1 - 78 is 3081
