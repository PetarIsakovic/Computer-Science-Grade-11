# Is It Prime? (Spicy)  

Write a program that will prompt the user to enter in an integer. Your program will then determine whether the number is prime or not. Remember, a prime number means that itâ€™s only numbers you can divide it by are 1 and itself. For instance, 13 is a prime number but 15 is not.

**Hint:** You will need to count how many divisors a number has. This means, start at 1 and see if it divides the number entered. Next you would try 2 and check if it can divide the number. Keep doing this until you reach the number.
