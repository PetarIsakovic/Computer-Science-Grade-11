# Hailstone Pattern (Spicy)  

The hailstone pattern comes from the Collatz conjecture. It is a sequence of numbers formed by using the following rules:

1. Start with a positive integer, call it n
2. If that number is even, the next number in the sequence is n/2
3. If the number is odd, the next number in the sequence is 3n + 1
4. When the number is 1, the sequence is finished

Write a program that will ask the user for a positive integer. It will then start with that integer and print out the hailstone sequence

## SAMPLE RUNTIME OUTPUT:

Please enter a positive integer to see the hailstone sequence.

  ```10```
  
Hailstone sequence is the following:

10

5

16

8

4

2

1
