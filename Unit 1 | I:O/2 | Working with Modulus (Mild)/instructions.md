# Working with Modulus (Mild)  
Back when you first started learning how to divide two numbers, you used to write down that x/y was “q with a remainder of r”. Let’s relive those days! Write a program that will ask the user for two numbers and then calculate the quotient of that number (the answer when you divide) and the remainder (what is left over if it doesn't divide fully). It will then output this to the user in a nice way. You will need to use the modulus (% operator) to calculate the remainder! We use it just like the divide symbol: 5%2 gives an answer of 1 because 5/2 gives a remainder of 1.

**Note:** an odd quirk with Java, if you are dividing integers, you can never get a decimal! So 5/2 is 2, not 2.5. It always rounds down. If you want to have a decimal place, you need to use doubles!


## SAMPLE RUNTIME OUTPUT:

Please enter in two integers, on seperate lines, to divide

`10`
  
`3`
  
10/3 is 3 with a remainder of 1
