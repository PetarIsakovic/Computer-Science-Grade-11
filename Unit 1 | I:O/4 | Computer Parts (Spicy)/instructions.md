# Computer Parts (Spicy)  

Our In-School Computer Technician is looking for a simple program that will help her calculate how much it would cost to purchase different quantities of computer parts she regularly uses. Below is a price list of the 3 most commonly used items:

- Chromebook charger: $34.99
- Replacement Motherboard: $127.50
- Computer Mouse: $18.00

Write a program that will prompt the user how many of each item they want to purchase. Your program will then calculate the subtotal (how much does it cost all together without taxes), the amount to taxes (13%) and the total.

As a refresher of how to calculate the tax, if an item costs $5 to purchase, tax = 5 x 0.13 = 0.65. In this case, the subtotal would be $5, the tax would be $0.65, and the total would be $5.65.


## SAMPLE RUNTIME OUTPUT:
How many chromebook chargers?

`3`

How many motherboards?

`2`

How many mice?

`5`

Subtotal = $449.97

Taxes = $58.496100000000006

Total = $508.46610000000004

### Want a Challenge?
We didn't talk about how to round numbers in Java. There is a command `Math.round(n)` where n is the number or variable you want to round. However, it only rounds to the nearest whole number. Can you figure out how to round to 2 decimal places?
