# Calculating Slope (Medium)  
Create a program to help grade 9s calculate the slope of a line given two points. For this, have the user enter in 2 points using 4 seperate lines (x1, y1, x2, y2). Then use the formula for slope (you remember that, donâ€™t you?)  (y2 -y1)/(x2 - x1) ) to output the slope to the user.

 ## Sample Output
Please enter in the x coordinate of the first point

 `3`

Please enter in the y coordinate of the first point

`6`

Please enter in the x coordinate of the second point

`8`

Please enter in the y coordinate of the second point

`16`

The slope of your line would be 2.0

<br/>**Note:** See the output has a decimal place in it? This is because the input is using a double instead of an integer. This allows our anwer to be things like 0.75!

### Want a challenge?
Can you get it to say `undefined slope` if it is a vertical line? This happens when you try to divide by 0. To do this, you need to use if statements, which we haven't covered yet. See if you can google and figure out out how to do an if statement in Java!
